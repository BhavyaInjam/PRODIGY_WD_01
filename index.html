  <h3>Frontend Development:</h3>
  <p>
    Frontend development involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It deals with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure content, style elements, and add interactivity. Frontend developers focus on ensuring that websites are visually appealing, responsive, and easy to use.
  </p>

  <h3>Backend Development:</h3>
  <p>
    Backend development focuses on the server-side logic and database management of a website or web application. It involves writing code that runs on the server, interacts with databases, and processes user requests. Backend developers handle tasks such as user authentication, data storage, and business logic implementation.
  </p>

  <h3>Full Stack Development:</h3>
  <p>
    Full stack development encompasses both frontend and backend development. Full stack developers are proficient in a wide range of technologies and can handle all aspects of web development, from designing user interfaces to writing server-side logic and managing databases. They have a comprehensive understanding of the entire web development process.
  </p>

  <h3>Mobile Web Development:</h3>
  <p>
    Mobile web development involves creating websites or web applications optimized for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Developers use responsive design techniques and mobile-friendly frameworks to ensure that websites adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and device capabilities.
  </p>

  <h3>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</h3>
  <p>
    PWAs are web applications that use modern web technologies to provide a native app-like experience to users. They offer features such as offline access, push notifications, and installation to the home screen. PWAs leverage service workers, web app manifests, and HTTPS to deliver reliable and engaging experiences across devices.
  </p>

  <h3>Static Site Generators:</h3>
  <p>
    Static site generators are tools that generate static HTML files based on templates and content. They are commonly used for blogs, documentation sites, and simple web applications. Static sites offer faster loading times, better security, and easier deployment compared to dynamic sites powered by server-side languages.
  </p>

  <h3>E-commerce Development:</h3>
  <p>
    E-commerce development focuses on building online stores and digital marketplaces where businesses can sell products or services over the internet. Developers integrate features such as product catalogs, shopping carts, payment processing, and order management to create seamless and secure online shopping experiences.
  </p>

  <h3>Content Management Systems (CMS):</h3>
  <p>
    CMS platforms provide tools and interfaces for creating, managing, and publishing digital content on the web. They offer features such as WYSIWYG editors, content organization, user management, and SEO tools. CMSs empower users to easily create and update websites without requiring technical expertise.
